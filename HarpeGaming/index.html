    Welcome to <strong>Harpe Gaming.</strong> We have a simple philosophy. It has three main points:
    <ul>
        <li>Unplug</li>
        <li>Interact</li>
        <li>Reconnect</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>And thats it. we believe thats the best games are the ones that bring people together 
    throuh shared experiences. With all due respect to our video <br> gamer friends, you 
    can't always get thet from a computer screen. Sometimes you need the intamate approach of 
    sitting face-to-face around a <br>common table with soda and chips at your elbow.</p>

    <p>We are a local board and card game store located in the heart of Morgantown near 
    campus. We carry hundreds of games and puzzles, <br>including edgucational games, family
    games, historical simulations, role-playing games, and so much more. If you remember a 
    great <br>game from your youth, we probably have it in our antigues collection. If we 
    don't, we know where you can get it.</p>

    <p>We're more then just a place to buy games. We celebrate gaming and the company of 
    good friends. Our game room is free for all to use. Sit down, <br>pick out a game 
    from our demo library and start playing. We sponsor tournaments, challenges, and 
    special social events. You'll always find a<br> game.</p>

    <p>We're always on the lookout for the best new games. We publish periodic reviews of new
    titles. Check out the review of
